    # Document Summary Assistant (Fixed - Local + Deployable)

    This repository contains a ready-to-run Document Summary Assistant with a React frontend (Vite) and an Express backend. The backend exposes `/api/summarize` which accepts file uploads and returns a human-like summary generated by OpenAI.

## Quick local run
1. Install Node.js (v18+) and npm
2. Extract the project and open in VS Code
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your OpenAI key

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs both the server (http://localhost:3000) and the frontend (http://localhost:5173). The frontend calls the backend at http://localhost:3000/api/summarize.

## Deploy
- For quick deployment on Vercel, convert `api/summarize` to a serverless function (provided in the earlier starter). Alternatively, you can deploy the Express server to Heroku/Railway and the frontend to Vercel.

## Notes
- Tesseract.js may be resource-intensive for large images; consider serverless OCR or a paid OCR API for production.
- Make sure to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment before running the server.
